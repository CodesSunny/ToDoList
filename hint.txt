this.closest('tr') is used inside an event handler function. Here, this refers to the element that triggered the event (e.g., the button that was clicked).

.closest('tr'):

Meaning: The closest method is used to find the nearest ancestor element of the current element that matches the specified selector. It starts from the current element and traverses up the DOM tree to find the closest ancestor element that matches the selector.
Selector: 'tr' is the selector used here. It represents a table row (<tr>).

How It Works:
When you use this.closest('tr'), it searches up the DOM tree starting from the element referenced by this and finds the closest <tr> element.

Selection Scope:

document.querySelector(".edit"):

This selects the first element with the class edit in the entire document.
If you have multiple rows with edit buttons, only the first button found in the document will have the event listener attached.
This is not suitable for dynamically created content, as only the first button is affected.

rowEl.querySelector('.edit'):

This selects the .edit button within the specific row (rowEl) where the button is created.
It ensures that each row's edit button gets its own event listener, even if you have multiple rows.
This is ideal for handling dynamically created elements within the specific row where the button was added.
